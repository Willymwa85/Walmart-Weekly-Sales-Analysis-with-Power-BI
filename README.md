# Walmart-Weekly-Sales-Analysis-with-Power-BI
The Walmart Weekly Sales Dashboard presented a comprehensive perspective of Walmart's sales dynamics, providing insights into weekly sales trends, store performance, economic effects, and the impact of holidays. Understanding these dynamics is critical for making sound decisions to improve weekly sales success and consumer satisfaction.
Weekly sales trends from 2010 to 2012 revealed a stunning upward trend followed by a downward trend. Economic recovery, successful marketing efforts, and holidays greatly impacted these patterns. Walmart should utilize agile tactics that respond to economic variations to capitalize on growth and prevent cuts.
Store Performance Analysis classified stores into three types: A, B, and C, emphasizing the relationship between store size and sales revenue. Walmart must keep investing in Type A and B stores while recognizing the value of Type C stores in niche markets to maximize performance.
Unemployment and CPI's impact on weekly sales emphasized the importance of consumer purchasing power. Leveraging insights from 2011, Walmart should focus on strategies that align with reduced unemployment and controlled CPI, such as targeted promotions and product diversification. Conversely, cost-effective pricing and essential product offerings become critical during economic challenges.
Regarding the Impact of Holidays, while holidays offer unique opportunities for engagement, Walmart's sales resilience during non-holiday periods showcases the importance of consistent strategies throughout the year.
